# Stuff and things relating to Powerpoint
This page is my page for cool things that you can do in Microsoft Powerpoint. I have made all of these in Powerpoint 2019 unless stated otherwise.

## Fractals!
Fractals can be created in Powerpoint. In earlier versions of powerpoint this involved pasting a link of a slide into itself, then reppeatedly saving. Now, we can put a Slide Zoom of a slide onto itself, which gives the following benefits:
- It doesn't lag
- It recursively iterates automatically
- Best of all, in Slide Show mode, YOU CAN CLICK TO ZOOM IN ON THE FRACTALS!!!!!!
