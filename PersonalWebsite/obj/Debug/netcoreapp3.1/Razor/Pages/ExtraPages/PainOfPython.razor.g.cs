    Let's talk datatypes. Python supports pretty much the same standard set as anything else, but with one problem.
    Python does not strongly type. This means you can not guarantee which type a function returns.
    The problem is wording: Strongly-typed languages use that term because strong is perceived as better than weak.
    Weakly-typed languages, on the other hand, call themselves Dynamically-typed, because that sounds better than
    Statically-typed.

    Let's say your friend has just sent you their first program and want you to try it out.
    Of course, when you run it you get silly errors. This is because they are using Python 2 and you are using 3, or
    vice versa. This is a problem because the Python team have been trying for years to get people to move to 3, but
    people just hang on to 2. There is actually a way we could fix this, which I'll talk about later.

    Python decided that, like other languages, it would be a good idea to allow members of a class to be private.
    The problem is execution. They decided to use Abstraction, which just changes the name of the member when out of
    scope. Private members should start with <code>_</code>, and Protected with <code>__</code>,
    but what the interpreter does is that a class called ""<code>Parent</code>"" with a member called
    ""<code>__hello()</code>""
    will become ""<code>_Parent__hello()</code>"" when out of scope, which is not what we want, because
    <em>it still exists</em>.

    So, if you wanted to learn C#, you would probably start with Visual Studio, a full featured IDE used by pros.

    IntelliJ, which is exceptional!)

    Now, even though this isn't exclusive to Python, this method of dealing with variables is a bit silly.
    From a glance at a variable use in, say, C#, I know whether it already exists, or I'm declaring a new one.
    Python doesn't have this, which can be annoying in larger programs, because if you try to define a variable that
    already exists, you won't get an error, it'll just override the old value, a potential bug causer.

    Compiled code is really fast, but needs compiling for each different type of processor. It also just
    <em>works</em>, without installing interpreters.
    Interpreted code has it's own benefits: you write your code, then you're done. Everyone can run it, just give
    them the script. Problem: it's SLOW!!! Yeah sure, there are things like PyPy that are faster, but PyPy only
    supports the aging Python 2.7, plus, the official CPython is still the goto, slow, interpreter.

    I'm not proposing that we just make Python a compiled language, it would be a massive undertaking, what I instead
    propose is to basically do Java again, where your code compiles to an intermediate language, which is then
    ran by a system similar to the Java VM. This is faster, because half of the work is done by the programmer when
    they ""build"" the project, but it's still compatible because of the interpreter approach.
