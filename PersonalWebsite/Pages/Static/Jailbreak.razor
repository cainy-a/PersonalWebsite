	<h1>Jailbreaking Adventures...</h1>
	<h3 style="text-align: right">...And Misadventures!</h3>
</div>

<h4>My first try: Unc0ver JB</h4>
<h5>The setup</h5>
<p>
	I have an iPhone 6S, and in this case I was running iOS 13.5.
	So, I used AltStore to install Unc0ver, and promptly hit that “Jailbreak” button.
	Hey look, I’m Jailbroken!
	Time to install Sileo, then <em>re-install</em> Cydia, then finally install Zebra and add some repos.
</p>

<h5>Stability</h5>
<p>
	Unc0ver is generally quite stable, and is really easy to use.
	One big button to hit and you’re cool.
	There are also advanced options for users who need them, such as removing the jailbreak and restoring the RootFS,
	or re-installing Cydia, or even installing OpenSSH for you.
</p>

<h5>Problems Encountered</h5>
<p>
	At first, Unc0ver worked nicely, and all was well.
	I could install tweaks, use AppSync with Filza to install IPAs, and clean out my storage with iCleaner.
	However, eventually something broke.
	All my jailbreak tweaks stopped working, and Unc0ver failed with the message “Unable to obtain entitlements.”
</p>

<h5>Resolution</h5>
<p>
	My first attempt to fix this was a Factory Reset.
	<em>BAD IDEA...</em> You should <em>never</em> factory reset while jailbroken because it breaks everything.
	Actual apple apps stopped working, Phone and Messages crashed, Contacts was blank, and Unc0ver itself remained broken.
	One tethered update through iTunes, from 13.5 to 13.5.1 later, and I was back to a completely stock iOS experience,
	except now there isn’t another update to save me in case of emergency.
	In addition, Unc0ver doesn’t work on 13.5.1; with that, let’s move on to...
</p>

<h4>Trying again: Checkra1n</h4>
<h5>The setup</h5>
<p>
	Same iPhone 6S as before, but now on iOS 13.5.1, I wanted to get Jailbroken again.
	In search of a new method, my gaze shifted over to Checkra1n.
	I needed to use a utility called “Bootra1n” (though there is an alternative called Checkn1x that I haven’t tried)
	because I do not have a Mac or Linux PC, only Windows.
	I flashed Bootra1n to a USB drive using Etcher, and booted to it.
	I’m happy to say that it worked!
</p>

<h5>Stability (and presentation)</h5>
<p>
	Checkra1n is very stable.
	Much more so than Unc0ver, even though Checkra1n’s site has a stability warning and Unc0ver doesn’t.
	I almost feel like Unc0ver tries to pitch itself as a legit, safe thing to do,
	while Checkra1n embraces the hacky, unstable nature and feel of jailbreaking.
	Overall, Checkra1n is much more stable than Unc0ver.
	I haven’t almost bricked my phone, and If something goes wrong and causes a respring loop, just reboot and you’re stock again.
	I think people are more instinctively gonna reach for the hard reset (power+home on my device)
	than the safe mode shortcut that they probably have no idea even exists (volume up).
</p>

<h5>Problems Encountered</h5>
<p>
	To nobody’s surprise, it turns out you can still cause respring loops, because the underlying tech is the same, just the exploit changed.
	I found that if <em>Prysm</em> or <em>Quart</em> were installed, installing the jailbroken version of <em>Watusi for WhatsApp</em>,
	would get you stuck in a respring loop. <small>Whoops.</small>
</p>

<h5>Resolution</h5>
<p>
	This can, however, be fixed easily.
	Simply go into your package manager of choice and use the re-install option on <em>Quart, Prysm</em>, etc. after booting into Safe Mode.
	Alternatively, install <em>Watusi</em>, and then do the reinstall before you even respring in the first place
	(if your package manager supports it, that is. <small>Zebra best package manager</small>). 
</p>


<h4>To finish off...</h4>
<p>
	Overall, my experience with Jailbreaking has been mixed,
	with my first experience being a bit of a fast-paced wild ride of tweak discovery,
	and my current attempt being more of a laid-back routine of incrementally improving my experience.
	Checkra1n may be tethered, but that allows it to be arguably more stable.
	Unc0ver may not support iOS 13.5.1, but supports iPhone XS and up,
	devices that have the Checkm8 exploit that Checkra1n relies on patched.
</p>
<p>
	Finally, here’s my recommendation.
	Both jailbreaks have their pros and cons, so if your device is supported,
	hop over to <a href="//checkra.in/">checkra.in</a> and give it a whirl.
	Otherwise look at either <a href="//unc0ver.dev/">unc0ver.dev</a> or <a href="//theodyssey.dev/">theodyssey.dev</a>
	(though I haven’t tried this one, I’ve heard it’s quite good), and just take it a bit slow. 
</p>

<h4>My Tweaks</h4>
<p>
	I thought it would be a good way to end this by providing a list of my installed jailbreak tweaks, on iOS 13.5.1,
	as well as which repos they came from.
