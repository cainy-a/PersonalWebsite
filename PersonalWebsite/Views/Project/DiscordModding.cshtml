<h3><a href="//github.com/cainy-a/Diskai">Diskai</a></h3>
<p>
	Diskai is my main theme, and where my main development effort goes.
	It is designed to look like the Monokai colour scheme,
	but ended up very different to my inital expectation.
</p>
<p>
	Diskai's big feature is CUSTOMISATION - <em>everything is customisable</em>.
	Want to change your accent colour? Go for it. Change the background colours? Sure!
	Wanna redefine the ENTIRE colour scheme? No problemo.
</p>
<p>
	I planned to make <em>Diskai Schemes</em>
	(a premade set of non-monokai inspired colour schemes for Diskai),
	but as of writing this page (2021-02-27 18:55 GMT), I haven't actually started yet... 
</p>
<p>
	<a href="//github.com/cainy-a/Diskai/#i-want-to-customise-it">Check out the full customisation guide.</a></p>
<p>
	It also has a sizable list of optional features, including
	a better user card,
	strikethrough muted channels,
	and compact mode provided by SmolCord (with some extra integration with Diskai's features)
</p>

<h3><a href="//github.com/cainy-a/SmolCord">SmolCord</a></h3>
<p>Ever feel like Discord wastes a lot of space? Yeah, me too.</p>
<p>
	SmolCord is a theme designed specifically to make Discord waste as little space as possible.
	It does this by removing unneeded space around certain things like
	context menus,
	the user and channel lists,
	and the server & chat headers.

<p>
	Lunacord is a faithful recreation of the Windows XP Luna Blue theme, based on XP.css.
